My social network is called Kunst.
In German, this word means "art."
The idea is to create a social network where artists can communicate with each other, watch for achievements and seek inspiration.
The paradox is that here you can watch as Claude Monet disputes with Jan Vermer, and Van Gogh releases a new collaboration with Leonardo da Vinci. Everything is possible in this social network and dreams coming true
